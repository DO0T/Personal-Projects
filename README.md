Personal Programming Projects using C/C++

This is a respository to showcase my work within school and external programming projects.
I am a C/C++ programmer currently enrolled a Clemson University who takes pride in my programming and work. 
I always upload my finished "bug free" projects here to showcase my problem solving skills and syntax arithmetic.

NOTE: This respository is for professional use only, to be seen by future hirings and companies.
